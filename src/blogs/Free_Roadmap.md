# Becoming a SOC Analyst Without Breaking the Pocket: A Complete Free Roadmap

Breaking into Cybersecurity—especially the SOC Analyst role—often looks expensive. Paid bootcamps, certifications, and labs can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. But the truth is this:

You can become a fully job-ready SOC Analyst using 100% free resources.
You only need the right roadmap.

In this article, I share my personal SOC Analyst learning path, every resource I'm using, and how you can follow the same journey without spending anything.

⭐ Why SOC Analyst?

A SOC (Security Operations Center) Analyst is the frontline defender of an organization. You monitor alerts, detect intrusions, analyze logs, respond to incidents, and keep systems secure.

It is one of the best beginner-friendly roles in cybersecurity—no programming degree or advanced math needed, just strong fundamentals and hands-on practice.
